40swap exposes a [RESTful API](/api/docs) that can be used to integrate swaps into an existing application.

The best way to integrate it will depend on you use case:
1. If you want to receive lightning payments to, follow the [integration-guide](integration-guide.md).  
2. If you own a lightning node and want to use 40swap to manage the node liquidity, you can use the [40swap-daemon](daemon.md).
